# name_generator.py

Given a list of adjectives, nouns and verbs, this script generates random names for your 
song/band/project/label/whatever.
 
Simply run the script on the command line, follow the prompts and let it do the rest.

You'll need to generate your own list of nouns/adjectives/verbs first â€“ just use one of 
the many web-based word generators out there and cherry-pick your favourite results. The 
more the better (I tested with 100 or so of each)
